# Payment Confirmation Flow

## üéØ **Two-Step Donation Process**

The donation system now implements a secure two-step process:

### Step 1: Create PENDING Donation
- User fills out donation form (amount, cause, payment method, message)
- System creates donation with `status: 'PENDING'`
- Donation is saved to database but not yet paid

### Step 2: Payment Confirmation
- Payment confirmation modal appears
- Shows donation summary (amount, cause, payment method)
- User can:
  - **Confirm Payment**: Updates status to `COMPLETED` and redirects to success page
  - **Cancel**: Keeps donation as `PENDING` for later payment
  - **Press ESC**: Same as cancel

## üîÑ **Payment Flow States**

1. **PENDING**: Donation created but not paid
2. **COMPLETED**: Payment processed successfully  
3. **FAILED**: Payment processing failed

## üé® **UI Features**

- **Loading States**: Shows spinner during processing
- **Confirmation Modal**: Clean, accessible design with donation summary
- **Keyboard Support**: ESC key closes modal
- **Background Lock**: Prevents scrolling when modal is open
- **Toast Notifications**: Real-time feedback for all actions

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Benefits**

- Two-step verification prevents accidental donations
- PENDING state allows users to review before payment
- Failed payments don't lose donation data
- Clear status tracking for audit trail

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

**Frontend:**
- React state management for modal and payment flow
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

**Backend Integration:**
